# Python Scripting, Encoding and IO 🐍📜📊

Interacting and manipulating different file types is an important skill for any Data Engineer. In the following tasks I created scripts to use the built in modules available in python and experiement with the different methods they offer.

All data files can be found in the `data` directory.

## Pizza CSV 🍕: 

- In this section, I worked with pizza data stored in a CSV file, leveraging Python to perform various operations. I extracted and manipulated pizza details, such as prices and ingredients, sorted pizzas based on criteria like price, identified specific attributes, added new entries, and adjusted prices.

## Cars JSON 🚗: 

- Within the realm of JSON data, I engaged with car information, showcasing my ability to navigate and manipulate JSON files using Python. I extracted and manipulated car attributes, including VIN, year, color, and fuel type. I also expanded the dataset, corrected data inaccuracies, and converted JSON to CSV format.

## Properties XML 🏠: 

- Handling XML data, I interacted with property details by employing Python's capabilities. I extracted and managed property-related information such as cost, description, number of bathrooms, and property type. I introduced new entries, adjusted prices, and created a dictionary with average property prices for different types.

## People YAML 👥: 

- Exploring YAML data, I navigated through personal details of individuals using Python. I extracted job information, interests, and ages, calculated average age, identified shared interests, and added new entries to the dataset. Additionally, I expanded the data by including personal information and introduced a "favourite colour" attribute for each person.

Extension task Pandas: As an extension, I ventured into the realm of Pandas, a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation. Though brief, I embarked on researching and experimenting with Pandas, gaining insight into its functionalities and potential applications in data science, analysis, and machine learning.
